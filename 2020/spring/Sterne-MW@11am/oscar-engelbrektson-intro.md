# Oscar Engelbrektson a.k.a the independent variable

**Oscar Engelbrektson** is another ember. The 21-year-old New York native has *17 goals* this season, all of them from long range. He has 12 at 5-on-5, which leads the league, and 11 more from the slot. He has done the same over his four seasons in the league, with 7 goals and 10 helpers through 64 games.

And that's just the start of it. Engelbrektson shows flashes of being a *very dangerous offensive player*, and should see himself leading the team in scoring and top line minutes moving forward. He brings a much needed skill set and offensive ability to a lineup that has struggled to find something to hit home runs with lately.
