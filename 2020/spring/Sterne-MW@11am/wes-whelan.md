*but where is he from*
Born on a small horse farm in Eastern Kentucky, Wes has grown up in the woods and with a guitar. A boy schout in his early years, he thrives in the wilderness and lives off the land. Currently, he spends most of his days **writing songs** about love and loss in his short life.

Thank you.
