## Intro

My name is **Herman Rocknocker**, and I'm a mountain dwarf of the highly respected *Rocknocker* family. It turns out that living in *Gundabad* was not my cup of tea, and so I'm currently sailing with a diverse group of (

 - relatively
 - annoying

) adventures towards *Itza* to recover a strange lizard-folk idol and save *Palax's* legacy.
