# Fictional biography of someone trying to learn SWE for the first time
Hi! I grew up in the **Himalayas** with an ultimate mission of climbing _Mount Everest_.

> The thing I crossed out of my life is ~~having a basement kitchen~~.

### The life I have lived so far has been:
1. Pretty dope.
2. Nice.
3. Rocky.

That's how I looked in summer 2021 climbing rocks in California. Yes, with a mirror.
