Hi, my name is Ha!

A few of my recent obsessions:

- Personal knowledge management: Notion, RemNote, Obsidian, and most recently, [Meta](https://projectmeta.app/)
- [This cool rock called Olivine that has the potential to reverse climate change at a fraction of current carbon capture technology costs](https://www.projectvesta.org/)
- Running (I've been in quarantine for too long)
- Reading fiction books ~~after an unhealthy consumption of non-fiction self-help books~~
- Vegan food in Berlin :heart_eyes: (to be fair, my obsession with food is not recent)
