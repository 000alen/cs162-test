### About Me
Hi! My name is ***Chika Jinanwa***, and I'm a Junior at Minerva University. I'm double majoring in Computer Science (concentration-*Applied Problem Solving*) and Natural Sciences (*concentration-Cells and Organisms*). I was born and raised in Nigeria, studied at Dority International Secondary School, before coming to the US for my college education. In my free time, I cook, play chess and table tennis, and take short naps. My "about" would be incomplete without mentioning chess. Chess is hands-down, my favorite game, and I spend hours on the board trying different combinations. Someday, I hope to be a Grandmaster. <br>
Courses I'm taking this semester are: <br>
1. CS162
2. CS164
3. NS144
4. CP191
