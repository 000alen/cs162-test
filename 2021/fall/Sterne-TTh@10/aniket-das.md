## Introduction
I'm a junior and CS major at Minerva Schools, a highly selective undergraduate program in the United States with a diverse student body. Apart from being a student and coder, I'm also a professional Rubik's Cube solver and retail investor. I was born in Mumbai, India, and lived there for 18 years, after which I've been traveling the world through International speedcubing competitions and as a part of Minerva’s Global Rotation. I’m interested in technology, finance, entrepreneurship, environmental sustainability, East Asian politics, traveling, and gaming. I aspire to leverage technology for sustainability and medical advances. Welcome to my page!
