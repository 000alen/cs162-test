## Hi there!

 I am a _Junior_ at *Minerva Schools at KGI*, pursuing a bachelor's in **Computer Science** (expected graduation is 2023). I love analyzing data, building machine learning models, tinkering with Raspberry Pis and microcontrollers, and automating monkey work. Sometimes I solve meaningful problems and build useful tools for companies, and other times I work on implementing my silly ideas. I am also a cryptocurrency enthusiast and believe that decentralized finance will eventually overtake the world.

When I am away from the screen, I usually backpack, cook, play guitar, or read books. In my daily actions, I aim to be (1) curious, someone who constantly asks questions and researches new areas; (2) entrepreneurial, someone who takes a proactive stand in life and is not afraid of starting something new; and (3) mindful, someone who is aware of his choices and continuously reflects on consequences of his actions.
