# Alex Bulintis
Hi, my *name* is **Alex Bulintis** and this is (not really) my biography!
Here are a few things I'm **good at**:

* Procrastinating on assignments
* JavaScript
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Saying *"oh god it's been 3 hours and i didn't do anything"* when doing pcw

### Here's a quote that keeps me motivated everyday:
> I like trains
