# A Biography
On January 16th, 2000, I broke the *world record* for youngest person alive on Earth. This impressive feat was short-lived, however; the competition was quick to catch up.
I moved **a lot** during my childhood, which inadvertently helped me prepare for my destiny as a Minerva student. Some of the places I've lived in include:
- Sao Paulo;
- Los Angeles;
- Sao Paulo state;
- ~~Hell~~ Rio de Janeiro;
- Sao Paulo state;
- Not Sao Paulo state.

```
One does not live in Rio twice.
- Me.
```

I can't wait to find out where I'll be moving once Minerva is over. And after that. And after that. Hopefully, not Rio.
