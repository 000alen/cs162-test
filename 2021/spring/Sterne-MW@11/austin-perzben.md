### An autobiography?

##### Well, I guess here you have a few facts about me:
- I have 3 dogs and 1 cat
- I used to have 3 turtles but one ran away and I released the others into a river near my house (yes i cried)
- I weight exactly as much as 400 average-sized potatoes... according to a very [quick Google search](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enPY851PY851&sxsrf=ALeKk01YTcECykciBTJUXdCXdXufT6VLAg%3A1610994299803&ei=e9IFYPe3MKTB0PEPgbiLMA&q=average+weight+of+a+potato+in+kg&oq=average+weight+of+a+potato+in+kg&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIICCEQFhAdEB46BAgAEEc6CwgAEMkDEBYQChAeUIg-WO0-YP0_aABwA3gAgAFYiAGsAZIBATKYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi34eW3jabuAhWkIDQIHQHcAgYQ4dUDCA0&uact=5).

##### And now a short story:
> _Once upon a time..._  
> I made the mistake of putting both hands on a lit iron fireplace and burned myself quite badly... All was well after a few weeks of healing... (yes i also cried when this happened)  
> _THE END_

##### Also, here's one of my **favorite** Python coding tricks:

```python
# When searching or sorting a dictionary, you can do so by value instead of by key using a simple lambda function!
mydict = {'key1': 84, 'key2': 45, 'key3': 98, 'key4': 23}
print(sorted(mydict, key=lambda x: mydict[x]))
```
> \>\>\>  ['key4', 'key2', 'key1', 'key3']


### See you in class!
