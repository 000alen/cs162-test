## About Me 
My name is Udodirim, but I prefer to be called *Dodie* for short. <br> I am in Prof. Sterne's CS162 class this semester and here are a few things I am looking forward to:
- Learning to use git
- Working collaboratively on a project with teammates
- Building something meaningful
- Getting practice with my desired career in *Product Management*
