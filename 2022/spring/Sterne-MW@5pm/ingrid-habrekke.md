## Ingrid's markdown file yay 

Hey besties,
 
I am Ingrid and this is my markdown file âœ¨

I'm _very_ excited to make a **pyramid scheme** with you guys this semester.

### Things I am interested in 
- Pyramid schemes ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸
- That's pretty much it

On a different note, [here](https://www.erdetfredag.dk) is my favorite website 
(despite it being Danish [^1]), as my emotions are decided by the following table


| Day           | Mood  |
|---------------|-------|
| Friday        | happy |
| Any other day | sad   |

### Summary
In case you skipped most of this chaotic file (understandable), here is a summary:

```
if friday or pyramid_scheme: 
    ingrid = happy
else: 
    ingrid = sad
```
