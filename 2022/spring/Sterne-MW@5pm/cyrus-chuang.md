# Hello, World! This is Cyrus Chuang
I am from **Taiwan** ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼. To introduce myself, I thought I could play a 2 truth 1 lie game:
1. I have never been to Scotland
2. I have never owned a cat
3. I have never liked Sriracha

Oh, and I'm a product designer. Check out [my website here](https://cyrushhc.com)

One of my favorite quote about technology: 

> *We are all looking out for the moment when technology would overwhelm human intelligence......But there's this much earlier moment when technology exceeds and overwhelms human weaknesses*
