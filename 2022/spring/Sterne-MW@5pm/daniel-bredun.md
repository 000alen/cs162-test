## Intro  
  
I use <font color="red">M</font><font color="orange">a</font><font color="darkyellow">R</font><font color="green">k</font><font color="lightblue">D</font><font color="blue">o</font><font color="pruple">W</font><font color="cyan">n</font> to take **all notes** in my <u>classes</u> because I think [Notion sucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/f2ois8/im_slowly_getting_disappointed_with_notion/).  
  
## Fair Comparison  
  
### Why Markdown  
  
1. It is *simple*.  
2. You can embed \<***html***\>\<\***html***\> so it is also *flexible*.  
   - Fox example, this   
    ```html  
    <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50">  
    ```   
    will be rendered as:  
    <input type="range" min="1" max="100" value="50">  
3. What else would you ever need?   
  
### Why not Notion  
  
- The mean time it takes to open a notion page is: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?t=\sqrt{17}%20\cdot%20\smallint"/> (a 💩 ton) *d*💩[^equation]  
- *(That's already enough for me to never return to that app)*.  
  
### Summary  
  
Now, let's sum it all up:  
  
|          | Notion   | Markdown        |  
| -------- | -------- | --------------- |  
| Suckness | Sucks 🍆 | Doesn't suck 😘 |  
  
## Conclusion  
  
Let's look at what we've achieved:  
  
- [x] 💩 on Notion  
- [ ] Mention Telegram?  
  
And, finally, as Mahatma Gandhi once said,  
  
> In the end, only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how masterfully you used Markdown.  
  
[^equation]: Also GitHub sucks because it still doesn't support embedded LaTeX equations and I had to run this file through a custom script to make the equation work.
