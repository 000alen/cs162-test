# History

Once upon a time, in a far away city, across the river from his future home, a child was born. Blessed with unimaginable abilities, unrelenting **drive** towards competition and some anxiety to prevent him from being OP.

## The competitions

Wanted to go to public schools to compete, and went on to become the most awarded competitor in math olympiads fromm the entire region [national second at 11yo](http://premiacao.obmep.org.br/2011/verRelatorioPremiadosOuro.do.htm). As well as the best ranked in areas such as astronomy and linguistics.

## The fall

Unfortunately, he got addicted and wasted years.

1. Playing league of legends
2. As a mono champion to make it even worse

## Phoenix Rising

After drifting through life, he decided to be the best human who ever lived. The strongest, smartest, and most humble person to walk this earth.

Beat saber player, Blockchain enjoyer
