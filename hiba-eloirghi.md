## Whimsical biography of myself

My name is Hiba, and I hate it when people call me **Heba**. I actually have a list of nicknames / mispronounciations and how I feel about them:
| nickname  | circumstances |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Hibi  | Reed called me this in an email.   |
| Hibs  | Ok I guess. Some friends call me this.  |
| Habi  | Berlin SXP staff member.  |
