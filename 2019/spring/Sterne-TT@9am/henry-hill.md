~~*hello?*~~

####  Oh

### I think I'm getting the hang of this...

# **HI!**
# Welcome to my whimsical `HELLO WORLD`, courtesy of **MARKDOWN**

As Julie Andrews once said,
> *Here are a few of my favorite things*

(in no particular order)

* Writing pretty Python
* John Mayer's music
* Delicious vegetarian fare

And some *not so favorite* things
(in an absolutely essential order)

1. Trying to write a **beautiful** Python expression in Javascript but of course it doesn't work because everything works in Javascript except the one way you want it to work...
1. John Mayer
1. Salad

That's all for now

*I guess*
