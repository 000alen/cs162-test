# About Me

Hi, I'm **Rany Hanna**! ðŸš€ I'm currently a _Computer Science_ major with a minor in _Cognitive Neuroscience_ at Minerva University.

- I have a deep passion for _learning_ and have had the incredible opportunity to study in **seven different countries** as part of my academic journey.
- As a student of _Cognitive Neuroscience_, I delve into understanding human behavior, decision-making, and learning processes. I'm particularly interested in **cognitive biases** and how they can be used for the benefit of individuals.
- I've given numerous talks to thousands of high school and college students in Egypt, sharing insights on _neuroplasticity_ and **positive thinking**.
- I love recommending _Duolingo_ to people as a fantastic tool for language learning and cross-cultural communication.
- My international experiences and passion for _ed tech_, _education_, the _brain_, and _AI_ make me excited to contribute to companies that align with these interests and values!!
